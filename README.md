# webfactory Frontend Code Katas

## How it works
 
Clone this repository and solve your katas locally. Each folder contains a kata with a brief and materials.

As for the solution â€“ "it depends". There are many ways to solve each task, and no right one. If you don't have a mentor 
to discuss _your_ way of answering the brief with, you can open a pull request and we'll try to give you feedback (fair 
warning: that might take some time, as we have a lot of work to do). 

Have fun!

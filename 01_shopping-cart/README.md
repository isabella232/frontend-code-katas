# 01: Build a shopping cart

THE SHOP wants to sell art prints via its website. Before they hire you for the job of building an e-commerce solution, 
they want to see a prototype where they can 

- add products to a shopping cart
- view the content of the shopping cart with a list of the products and their respective amounts
- edit the shopping cart's content (change amount of products or delete them from the cart)
- see the overall amount of items that are currently in the shopping cart in the website's header when they browse THE SHOP.

The prototype should use `localStorage` to keep track of a customer's shopping cart even when they close the browser.

Because it's a prototype, it only needs to work for a desktop-sized viewport (>1280px) and in current Firefox or Chrome.
